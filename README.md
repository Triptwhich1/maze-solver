# What is this?

This is a project I worked on during my Robotics course, where I designed and implemented a hybrid robot controller to explore and map a 5x5 maze autonomously. By doing this project it improved my understanding of how to integrate real world-sensor date with software control systems to solve a real-world robotics problem.
